Filename: ComplexCode.js
Description: This code demonstrates a complex implementation of a chatbot that has multiple functionalities, including natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and speech synthesis.

Please note that due to the complexity and length of the code, only a brief outline with some snippets will be provided. The complete code is beyond the scope of this platform.

// Import necessary modules and components
const NaturalLanguageProcessing = require('nlp-library');
const SentimentAnalysis = require('sentiment-analysis-library');
const SpeechSynthesis = require('speech-synthesis-library');

// Initialize components
const nlp = new NaturalLanguageProcessing();
const sentiment = new SentimentAnalysis();
const speech = new SpeechSynthesis();

// Define chatbot functionality
function chatbot(message) {
  // Preprocess message
  const processedMessage = nlp.preprocessMessage(message);
  
  // Perform sentiment analysis
  const sentimentScore = sentiment.analyzeSentiment(processedMessage);

  // Determine appropriate response based on sentiment
  let response;
  if (sentimentScore > 0.5) {
    response = "I'm glad to hear that!";
  } else if (sentimentScore < -0.5) {
    response = "I'm sorry to hear that. How can I assist you?";
  } else {
    response = "Interesting. Tell me more.";
  }

  // Synthesize response into speech
  const speechOutput = speech.synthesizeSpeech(response);

  // Return response
  return speechOutput;
}

// Examples of interacting with the chatbot
const userMessage1 = "I had a great day today!";
const botResponse1 = chatbot(userMessage1);
console.log(botResponse1);

const userMessage2 = "I'm feeling down. Can you help?";
const botResponse2 = chatbot(userMessage2);
console.log(botResponse2);

const userMessage3 = "I'm not sure what to do right now.";
const botResponse3 = chatbot(userMessage3);
console.log(botResponse3);

// ... More examples and additional functionalities can be added below

// Execute complex code
